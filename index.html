        <p>
            We have developed a simple messaging application for use on devices with the android operating system.

            Each time a message is sent through the app the user is able to specify a ‘key phrase’ themselves to encrypt
            the message before it is sent to the user receiving the message, who must then use this key to decrypt the
            message on their device.

            The app uses AES-256 encryption to encrypt the messages before sending them across the server to receiver.

            Users must agree on a key phrase with the intended recipient which can then be entered into the input box
            at the top of the application screen, the sending user then types their message into the message box in
            the lower portion of the screen and hits the send button.
